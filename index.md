I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton. This is my first year at CSUF and I am planning on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6, Part 2: 
Part 2 of lab number 6 was one of my favorite labs because it taught me how to properly play blackjack. This lab was also one of the first ones that really helped me expand my knowledge of working with using if statements to pick random numbers.

Lab 7: 
Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs to do because when given special restrictions, I got to learn how to meet those restrictions through the use of if statements. I also got to learn how to implement the “OR” and “AND” operators in my code. In this case, those were specific dates and times cars can or cannot be parked on that specific street.

Lab 11: 
I enjoyed doing lab 11 because personally for me, it was one of the easier ones. I believe the reason for this is because with the knowledge I have gained from both the lecture and the lab, I was easily able to understand what the lab was asking me to do. This lab made me sure that to a certain level I am comfortable with using const, int, etc., in my code.
